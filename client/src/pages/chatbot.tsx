* Quad stretch: Stand on one leg, grab your ankle, and pull gently toward your buttocks
* Calf stretch: Step one foot back, heel down, and lean forward slightly
* Hip flexor stretch: Lunge forward, keeping your back straight
* Shoulder stretch: Cross one arm across your chest and hold with the opposite hand
* Child's pose: Great for lower back relief

Hold each stretch for 15-30 seconds and remember to breathe deeply. Would you like me to explain any of these in more detail?`;

* Banana with 1 tbsp of peanut butter
* Apple slices with a small handful of almonds
* Greek yogurt with berries
* Whole grain toast with avocado

Based on your profile and weight loss goals, I'd recommend keeping this snack around 150-200 calories.`;

* Fun and engaging, which helps you stay motivated
* Scalable - you can modify moves to your fitness level
* Effective for burning calories (300-500 per hour)
* Great for building coordination and rhythm

Zumba is particularly beginner-friendly because it combines simple dance steps with fitness moves. The instructor typically shows modifications, and you can go at your own pace.

* Zumba: 400-600 calories/hour
* Hip Hop: 370-610 calories/hour
* Bollywood: 350-550 calories/hour
* Salsa: 400-480 calories/hour

The exact amount depends on:
* Your intensity level
* Your current fitness level
* How continuously you dance
* Your weight and body composition

For most effective calorie burning, aim for 30-60 minute sessions, 3-5 times per week. Would you like a custom dance workout plan to maximize your calorie burn?`;
